<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
<section id="introduction" class="section">
  <h2 class="section-title">Introduction</h2>

  <p><strong>Metta</strong> is a foundational Domain-Specific Language (DSL) within the Quassar environment, designed to enable the creation of new DSLs through the declarative definition of metamodels. Its goal is to let developers design custom modeling languages tailored to specific domains — without having to write parsers or grammar rules by hand.</p>

  <p>Instead of describing DSLs through low-level grammars such as EBNF or parser generators, Metta focuses on defining the structure of a language itself. A metamodel written in Metta specifies the essential building blocks of a DSL — including concepts, properties, components, facets, and semantic rules. These elements capture the organization of the domain and define how its parts relate to one another, forming the blueprint from which the DSL is automatically generated.</p>

  <p>A typical metamodel includes concepts, properties, optional facets, composition relationships, and formal constraints. Once the metamodel is defined, it is transformed automatically into a working DSL. This is done through a specialization process over a shared base language called <strong>Tara</strong>. Tara provides the common syntax and grammar, while Metta injects domain-specific vocabulary and semantic rules. The result is a concrete DSL that can be used to model real-world instances using a consistent, expressive, and safe syntax.</p>

  <p>The DSL produced from Metta can be used for configuration, simulation, validation, or code generation. It preserves the structure and logic defined in the metamodel, ensuring that models are aligned with the domain’s semantics from the start.</p>

  <p>Metta is especially suited for domains with layered abstractions, such as smart cities, digital twins, industrial systems, and autonomous agents. It addresses the common pain points in DSL development — fragmentation, inconsistency, and duplication — by offering a single, reusable foundation from which reliable domain languages can be systematically derived.</p>
</section>

<!-- CORE CONCEPTS -->
<section id="core-concepts" class="section">
  <h2 class="section-title">Core Concepts</h2>
  <p>Metta is centered around a set of semantic constructs that enable the structured definition of DSLs. This approach allows developers to generate new DSLs automatically, with consistent structure and semantics, tailored precisely to the needs of any domain.
</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Concept</strong>: A category that groups entities sharing the same structure and defining properties. Concepts are derived from metaconcepts and serve as templates for instantiating specific elements in lower levels of abstraction.</li>
    <li><strong>Facet</strong>: An optional dimension that can be assigned to concepts or entities to enrich them with additional properties or behaviors. Facets support polymorphism and modularity, allowing cross-cutting features to be modeled cleanly.</li>
    <li><strong>Property</strong>: A descriptive feature of a metaconcept or concept. Properties define the internal structure of elements and may include constraints on type, value ranges, or units of measurement.</li>
    <li><strong>Relationship</strong>: A semantic link between elements, such as generalization/specialization, composition, or abstraction/concretization. These define how concepts and entities are structured and interrelated within the domain.</li>
    <li><strong>Semantic Rule</strong>: A formal constraint that governs the validity of models. These include rules about instantiation, property immutability, required facets, component cardinality, and more. Semantic rules ensure that the model aligns with the logic of the domain.</li>
  </ul>

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
<section id="getting-started" class="section">
  <h2 class="section-title">Getting Started</h2>
  <p>This section introduces <em>brico</em>, a DSL for modeling smart buildings. It walks you through a minimal working example, showing how to define your domain in Metta and then instantiate it using the brico language.</p>

  <h3>Step 1: Define the domain with Metta</h3>
  <p>We start by describing the abstract structure of a building system: a campus is composed of buildings, which contain floors, rooms, and sensors. Each element includes its own properties and constraints.</p>
  <pre><code class="language-metta">Concept Campus
    def string manager
    def string location
    Concept:{1..*} Building
        def string address
        def integer yearBuilt
        has Sensor
        Concept:{1..*} Floor
            def integer level
            Concept:{1..*} Room
                def integer area
                has Sensor

Concept Sensor is component
    facet Type
        sub Temperature
        sub Humidity
        sub CO2
  </code></pre>

  <h3>Step 2: Validate the metamodel</h3>
  <p>Run the check operation to ensure the model has no structural or semantic errors. Any issues must be fixed before continuing.</p>

  <h3>Step 3: Commit the version</h3>
  <p>Once validated, use the commit operation to save the metamodel as version 1.0.0. Future changes will ask whether to register a major, minor, or patch update, and the version number will be updated accordingly.</p>

  <h3>Step 4: Forge the DSL</h3>
  <p>Use the forge operation to create the DSL based on your metamodel. You’ll be taken to the DSL’s forge interface, where you can configure:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Name: brico</li>
    <li>Logo: auto-generated, editable</li>
    <li>Title: Brico — DSL for modeling smart building structures</li>
    <li>Description: A language for defining campuses, buildings, rooms, and sensors</li>
    <li>How to cite: Editable text</li>
    <li>License: Defaults to MIT (can be changed)</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Step 4.1 (optional): Create a model template</h4>
  <p>In the Kit tab, define a starter structure or files that will appear when someone creates a new model with brico.</p>

  <h4>Step 4.2 (optional): Add examples</h4>
  <p>Also in the Kit tab, you can include example models to help users get started faster.</p>

  <h4>Step 4.3 (optional): Write documentation</h4>
  <p>In the Help tab, you can write the reference guide for your DSL, explaining concepts, syntax, and examples.</p>

  <h4>Step 4.4: Define the execution environment</h4>
  <p>To enable execution, simulation, or transformation of models, use the Execution Environment tab. This environment is built using the automatically generated parser library.</p>

  <p>The parser lets you load and work with models programmatically. You can download it or add it as a Maven dependency. It’s the foundation for anything you want to build on top of your DSL — from code generators to runtime engines.</p>

  <h3>Step 5: Start modeling</h3>
  <p>Once the DSL is forged, you can use the start modeling operation to create and edit actual models using brico.</p>

  <p>Here is an example of a concrete model:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-brico">Campus North
  manager = "Alice Rivera"
  location = "North Zone"

  Building Alpha
    address = "123 Innovation Blvd"
    yearBuilt = 2012

    Floor(level = 1)
      Room(area = 35)
        Sensor is Temperature
        Sensor is CO2
      Room
        area = 28
        Sensor is Humidity

    Floor(level = 2)
      Room
        area = 42
        Sensor is Temperature

  Building(address = "125 Innovation Blvd", yearBuilt = 2015) Beta 
    Floor(level = 0) > Room(area = 30) > Sensor is CO2</code></pre>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    Tip: This example is ready to copy and modify. You can rename buildings, change sensor types, or adjust the structure as needed.

  <h2 class="section-title">DSL Reference</h2>
  <p>This section provides detailed, structured reference for each top-level construct in the DSL.</p>

  <!-- ============ BLOCK FOR A PROPERTY CONCEPT ============ -->
<h3 class="concept-title">Properties and Relationships</h3>

<h4>Syntax</h4>
<pre class="syntax-block"><code>property ::= "def" type IDENTIFIER [ "=" literal ]

type ::= [ primitiveType ":" identifer | "word" ":"" "{" wordlist "}" | IDENTIFIER ][ "[" "]" 

primitiveType ::= "string" | "integer" | "boolean" | "double" | "long" | "instant"

wordList ::= stringLiteral { "," stringLiteral }

literal ::= scalarLiteral | listLiteral

scalarLiteral  ::= stringLiteral | integerLiteral | booleanLiteral | doubleLiteral

listLiteral ::= "[" scalarLiteral { "," scalarLiteral } "]"
</code></pre>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<div class="example-block">
  <p class="example-label">Primitive Properties</p>
  <p class="example-description">
    This example defines a Room concept using several primitive properties. The property name is a string that identifies the room. The property area is an integer representing the surface in square meters. The property hasWindow is a boolean with a default value of true, indicating whether the room has natural light. Finally, ceilingHeight is a double with a unit of measurement in centimeters (cm), and a default value of 300.
  </p>
  <pre><code>Concept Room
  def string name
  def integer area 
  def boolean hasWindow = true
  def double:cm ceilingHeight = 300
</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="example-block">
  <p class="example-label">Word Properties</p>
  <p class="example-description">
    This concept uses multiple enumerated properties to define categorical characteristics. Each property restricts the valid values to a predefined list.
  </p>
  <pre><code>Concept Device
  def word:{Online, Offline, Maintenance} status = Online
  def word:{Low, Medium, High} batteryLevel
  def word:{Sensor, Actuator} type = empty
</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="example-block">
  <p class="example-label">List Properties</p>
  <p class="example-description">
    This example defines two properties. tags is a list of strings used to label or categorize an element (e.g., "public", "featured"). status is an enumerated property restricted to three valid values, ensuring consistent classification across instances.
  </p>
  <pre><code>def string[] tags = ["public", "featured"]
def word:{Active, Inactive, Pending} status</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="example-block">
  <p class="example-label">Relational Property</p>
  <p class="example-description">
    This example shows how to define a property that links an object to another instance in the model. Here, an Incident is associated with a specific Building< using a reference-type property.
  </p>
  <pre><code>Concept Incident
  def string description
  def instant timestamp
  def Building building
</code></pre>
</div>

<h4>Rules and Notes</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Supported types include primitives, lists of primitives, and constrained enumerated sets using <code>word:{...}</code>.</li>
  <li>Default values are optional and must conform to the type (a literal or a list).</li>
  <li>List values use square brackets and blank-separated literals, e.g., <code>["a" "b" "c"]</code>.</li>
  <li>Each property name must be unique within its concept or metaconcept scope.</li>
  <li>Semantic metadata such as immutability, measurement units, or cardinality must be declared separately via constraints.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="tip">
  <strong>Tip:</strong> Use <code>[]</code> to declare list-based properties, and <code>word:{...}</code> when you need a fixed set of valid values.
</blockquote>

<!-- ============ BLOCK FOR A DSL CONCEPT ============ -->
<h3 class="concept-title">Concept</h3>

<h4>Syntax</h4>
<pre class="syntax-block"><code>concept ::= "Concept" [ cardinality ][ IDENTIFIER ][ extension ][ modifierList ]
                    { INDENT conceptBody }

conceptBody ::= property

<h4>Examples</h4>

<div class="example-block">
  <p class="example-label">Basic Concept</p>
  <p class="example-description">
    This example defines a basic concept called Sensor, marked as a component, meaning it is designed to be included inside other concepts rather than instantiated independently. It has two string properties: id, which uniquely identifies the sensor within the system, and manufacturer, which records the name of the company or entity that produced the device. This concept can be reused across different models where sensing elements are required, such as in buildings, vehicles, or environments.
  </p>
  <pre><code>Concept Sensor is component
    def string id
    def string manufacturer</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="example-block">
  <p class="example-label">Concept including component</p>
  <p class="example-description">
    This example defines a concept named Floor, which includes a nested concept called Room. Inside Room, there is a composition reference to Sensor using the has keyword. This illustrates the two main ways to express composition in Metta. The first is structural composition, where a concept is declared inside another — as Room is declared inside Floor. The second is referential composition, where one concept includes another via has — as Room includes Sensor. The referenced concept (Sensor) is typically marked with is component to indicate that it is meant to be embedded rather than used independently.
  </p>
  <pre><code>Concept Floor
  def integer level
  Concept Room
    def integer area
    has Sensor</code></pre>
</div>


<div class="example-block">
  <p class="example-label">Concept with Cardinality and Modifier</p>
  <p class="example-description">
    This example defines a concept named Building. The cardinality declaration {1..*} indicates that at least one instance of Building must exist wherever it is used (e.g., within a parent concept like Campus). The concept is also marked as abstract, which means it cannot be instantiated directly. Instead, it is intended to be specialized by other concepts (e.g., ResidentialBuilding, OfficeBuilding) that inherit its structure and extend it. This is useful for enforcing a shared base structure while requiring domain-specific variants.
  </p>
  <pre><code>Concept:{1..*} Building is abstract
  def string address
  def integer yearBuilt</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="example-block">
  <p class="example-label">Facet Declaration</p>
  <p class="example-description">
    Defines a facet that can be applied to Room entities to indicate emergency access availability.
  </p>
  <pre><code>Concept Room
    facet EmergencyAccess
        def boolean enabled = false</code></pre>
</div>

<h4>Rules and Notes</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Concept is used to declare domain abstractions and their structure.</li>
  <li>A concept may contain properties, components, nested sub-concepts, and facet declarations.</li>
  <li>Cardinality can be used to enforce how many instances of a sub-concept or component are expected.</li>
  <li>Concept names must be unique within the same context. Nested concepts are scoped locally.</li>
  <li>Facet declarations inside a concept define optional extensions applicable to other concepts or entities.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="tip">
  <strong>Tip:</strong> Use concept nesting to structure complex domains hierarchically and reuse concepts via <code>has</code> or <code>facet</code>.

<!-- USE CASES -->
<section id="use-cases" class="section">
  <h2 class="section-title">Use Cases</h2>
  <p>Below are practical examples showing how metamodels written in Metta give rise to usable DSLs, and how those DSLs are then used to describe concrete scenarios.</p>

  <h3>Smart Campus</h4>
  <p>
    This metamodel defines a campus composed of buildings, which contain floors and rooms. Each room may include sensors of various types. Once committed and forged, it produces a DSL (e.g., <em>brico</em>) that users can apply to model real environments such as a university or office complex.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Metamodel</strong></p>
  <pre><code class="language-metta">Concept Campus
  def string manager
  def string location
  Concept:{1..*} Building
    def string address
    def integer yearBuilt
    has Sensor
    Concept:{1..*} Floor
      def integer level
      Concept:{1..*} Room
        def integer area
        has Sensor

Concept Sensor is component
  facet Type
    sub Temperature
    sub Humidity
    sub CO2
</code></pre>

  <p><strong>Model</strong></p>
  <pre><code class="language-brico">Campus North
  manager = "Alice Rivera"
  location = "North Zone"

  Building Alpha
    address = "123 Innovation Blvd"
    yearBuilt = 2012

    Floor(level = 1)
      Room(area = 35)
        Sensor is Temperature
        Sensor is CO2
      Room(area = 28)
        Sensor is Humidity

    Floor(level = 2)
      Room(area = 42)
        Sensor is Temperature
</code></pre>


<h3>Patient Monitoring</h3>
<p>
  This metamodel defines a hospital system with patients, rooms, and vital signs. Patients are associated with rooms and include vital signs as components. Each vital sign facet declares a threshold and expects a measured value that may be used for alerts or clinical analysis.
</p>

<p><strong>Metamodel</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-metta">Concept Hospital
  def string name
  Concept:{1..*} Room
    def integer number

Concept Patient
  def string fullName
  def integer age
  def Room room
  has VitalSign

Concept VitalSign is component
  facet Type
    sub Temperature
      def double:°C value
      def double:°C threshold = 38.0
    sub HeartRate
      def integer:bpm value
      def integer:bpm threshold = 100
    sub SpO2
      def integer:% value
      def integer:% threshold = 90
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Model</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-clinic">Hospital General
  name = "St. Mary Hospital"
  Room(number = 101) R101
  Room(number = 102) R102

Patient
  fullName = "Laura Gómez"
  age = 46
  room = General.R101
  VitalSign is Temperature
    value = 37.4
  VitalSign is SpO2
    value = 92

Patient
  fullName = "Tomás Ibáñez"
  age = 72
  room = General.R101
  VitalSign is HeartRate(value = 108)

Patient
  fullName = "Lina Ruiz"
  age = 35
  room = General.R102
  VitalSign is Temperature(value = 39.1)
  VitalSign is HeartRate(value = 95)
    
</code></pre>

</section>

<!-- SYNTAX SUGAR -->
<section id="syntax-sugar" class="section">
  <h2 class="section-title">Syntax Sugar</h2>
  <p>To keep models concise and readable, DSLs generated from Metta support a few syntax shortcuts. These are syntactic sugars that make writing models faster without changing their meaning.</p>

  <h4>1. Property values can be written in the constructor or in the body</h4>
  <p>You can assign values to properties either inside the constructor or as indented assignments in the body. Both styles are equivalent and can be mixed as needed.</p>

  <pre><code class="language-example">Person pau
  age = 35

Person(age = 35) pau

Person(35) pau
</code></pre>

  <p>In the last form, the value is assigned positionally, according to the order of properties in the concept definition.</p>

  <h4>2. Single child blocks can be shortened with <code>></code></h4>
  <p>When a block contains exactly one indented element, you can replace the block with a single-line version using the <code>&gt;</code> symbol. This keeps the model clean when nesting is minimal.</p>

  <pre><code class="language-example">Concept Person
  def int age

Person > age = 35

Person
  age = 35
</code></pre>

  <p>Both forms are equivalent. The <code>&gt;</code> is especially useful when a concept includes just one property, component, or nested element.</p>

  <h4>3. Instance names are optional</h4>
  <p>In most cases, you can omit the name of an instance if it's not needed for reference. This makes the model cleaner when working with anonymous or throwaway objects.</p>

  <pre><code class="language-example">Room
  number = 101

Patient
  fullName = "Laura Gómez"
  age = 46
</code></pre>

  <p>If needed, you can still assign a name for later reference:</p>

  <pre><code class="language-example">Patient laura
  fullName = "Laura Gómez"
  age = 46
</code></pre>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    Tip: These shortcuts improve fluency, but you can always fall back to the full form for clarity or consistency.
  </blockquote>

<!-- BEST PRACTICES -->
<section id="best-practices" class="section">
  <h2 class="section-title">Best Practices</h2>
  <p>To get the most out of Metta and build DSLs that are maintainable, expressive, and reusable, it's important to follow a few design principles when creating your metamodels.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Focus on the domain, not the implementation.<br>
      Capture the core concepts, structure, and logic of your domain. Avoid including technical details like data formats, algorithms, or user interfaces in the metamodel.
    </li>

    <li>
      Keep concepts focused and cohesive.<br>
      Each concept should represent a single, well-defined idea. If it grows too broad, consider splitting it or using facets to modularize optional features.
    </li>

    <li>
      Use facets for reusable or optional traits.<br>
      When a property or behavior is relevant across multiple concepts, define it as a facet instead of duplicating the same fields.
    </li>

    <li>
      Prefer composition over inheritance.<br>
      Use has relationships to represent structure and avoid deep hierarchies. This keeps your models modular and easier to evolve.
    </li>

    <li>
      Declare constraints explicitly.<br>
      Use formal rules like instantiation lock, component lock, or immutability to express your design intent clearly. Don't rely only on naming or documentation.
    </li>

    <li>
      Use clear and domain-specific names.<br>
      Avoid generic terms like item, object, or thing. Choose names that reflect how people in the domain actually speak.
    </li>

    <li>
      Provide thoughtful defaults and enumerations.<br>
      When possible, define sensible default values. If you use enumerations (word:{...}), make sure the list of options is complete and unambiguous.
    </li>

    <li>
      Begin at the metaconcept level.<br>
      Start by identifying the core types of concepts your DSL will need. This helps organize the model and makes the language easier to generate and extend.
    </li>

    <li>
      Validate early and iterate often.<br>
      Don't wait until the model is finished to test it. Generate and test DSL examples as you go to verify that your structure behaves as expected.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote class="tip">
    Tip: You don't need to design the perfect model on day one. With Metta, you can evolve your language safely as your understanding of the domain deepens.

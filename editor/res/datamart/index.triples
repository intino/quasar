metta.dsl	title	A meta DSLs for defining domain metamodels and generating custom DSLs
metta.dsl	description	metta is a domain metamodeling language used to define the structure, semantics, and conceptual boundaries of a domain. It acts as the entry point in the Quassar DSL derivation pipeline. By writing a metamodel in metta, users describe the high-level building blocks—such as categories, relationships, and facets—that organize knowledge in a domain.␤␤From this metamodel, Quassar automatically generates a fully operational Domain-Specific Language (DSL) customized to that conceptual structure. The generated DSL inherits a unified grammar from tara (Quassar’s mother DSL) and extends it with a lexicon and semantics derived from the metamodel, ensuring that the resulting language is both syntactically consistent and semantically meaningful.␤␤metta enables domain experts to define a DSL by focusing on what exists in the domain and how those elements relate, rather than how to manually implement language syntax or parsing rules. It transforms structural knowledge into executable linguistic tools.
